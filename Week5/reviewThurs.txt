angular
	routing
		allows us to swap components dynamically based on the URL path
		app-routing.module.ts
			contains the path mappings
		<router-outlet></router-outlet>
			specifies WHERE the routed component will show up
		route guards
			ng g guard guard-name
			allow you to set up logic that prevents certain routes from
				being accessed if a certain condition is not met
			for example, an admin guard could restrict the /admin route
	pipes
		<ng-container *ngFor="let sprite of sprites | keyvalue">
			- keyvalue is a predefined pipe
			- date, currency, upper case, lower case, percent, title case are other predefined pipes
		for formatting or filtering
		implement the transform method with a value and output
			any parameters can be added as well
			transform(value: Move[], searchText: string): Move[] { }
			<li *ngFor="let move of moves | moveFilter:filterText">
